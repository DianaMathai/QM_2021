1. Academic writing
   1. [Creating & Managing Long Documents](http://training.nottingham.ac.uk/Public/O2016/WordCreatManLongDocs.pdf). 
      1. Comments: a comprehensive hands-on guidance on the formatting of MS Word 2016, although there are some minor changes in the later version of MS Word. Recommending reading the sections of  **Chapter 4 Styles**, **Chapter 9 Captions**, **Chapter 10 Cross-Referencing**. 
      2. **Who should read this?** If you haven't used the style/captions/cross-referencing in MS word, this tutorial is highly recommended.
   2. [Getting started with Mendeley](https://desktop-download.mendeley.com/download/Getting_Started_Guide.pdf)
      1. Comments: a hands-on tutorial on using Mendeley for academic writing. Mendeley is a reference managing tool, which relieves you from manually managing hundreds of references.
      2. **Who should read this?** People who haven't used Mendeley/Zotero/Endnote before in writing.
   3. [Harvard reference style](https://library.aru.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.htm) 
   4. [Harvard Format Citation Guide from Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/harvard-citation-guide)
   5. [Harvard referencing conventions from UCL](https://library-guides.ucl.ac.uk/referencing-plagiarism/harvard)
      1. Comments: when using Mendeley (or alternatives), it is essential to let the software know what style of reference you want to use. Like the differing date formats, there are various reference styles - Harvard, MLA, APA, to name a few. The good thing is, you don't need to know all of them. Just use Harvard for this module and many other modules. So this is a quick introduction to Harvard style, and it is quite easy to use it in Mendeley. 
      2. **Who should read this?** Almost everyone (including myself). It doesn't take long, I promise.
