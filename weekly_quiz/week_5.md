## QM quiz for Week 5: Hypothesis testing

**Last update: 01/11/2022**

1. **Which of the following statements about P value are true?** (d)

   a. The P value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true.  

   b. The P value is the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true.  

   c. The P value is the probability of obtaining the observed or more extreme results if the alternative hypothesis is true.  

   d. The P value is the probability of obtaining the observed results or results which are more extreme if the null hypothesis is true. 

   e. The P value is always less than 0.05.  

2. **Which null hypothesis is suitable for the given study? **(a)

   a. "There is no difference in drinking rates of men and women" in an experiment of comparing the amount of alcohol consumed by men and women.  

   b. "The weight of men is greater than women" in a study of comparing the weights of men and women.  

   c. "People from families with genetic disorders in the population are more likely to experience problems when applying for life insurance than those from the general population" in a study of comparing the possibility of getting life insurance between people from families with genetic disorders and the general population.

   d. None of the above.

3. **What is the alternative hypothesis for a linear regression model between housing prices (y variable) and the number of nearby bus stations (x variable)?** (d)

   a. There is a positive linear relationship between housing prices and the number of bus stations.

   b. There is a negative linear relationship between housing prices and the number of bus stations.

   c. There is no linear relationship between housing prices and the number of bus stations.

   d. There is a linear relationship between between housing prices and the number of bus stations, which could be either positive or negative.


4. **Two types of errors associated with hypothesis testing are Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative). What are correct statements about Type I error and Type II error** (c, d)

   a. Type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis whilst the alternative hypothesis is true.

   b. Type II error occurs when we reject a null hypothesis when it is true.

   c. Type II error occurs when we accept a null hypothesis when it is not true.

   d. Type I error occurs if an innocent person is arrested by police.

   e. Type I error occurs if a deserving player is not selected in the national team.

5. **If we are interested in testing to see if patients have been a significant change in reported blood sugar before intervention and after the intervention, then what tests could we possibly use?** (c)

   a. One sample t-test

   b. Independent samples t-test

   c. Paired samples t-test

   d. None of the above

6. **Which of the following statements about the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test is true?** (a, c)

   a. K-S test can be used to decide if a sample comes from a population with a specific distribution.

   b. K-S test is based on the minimum distance in cumulative probability between two distribution curves.

   c. K-S test statistic does not depend on the underlying cumulative distribution function being tested.

   d. All of the above.
