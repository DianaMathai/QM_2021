1. **We want to construct a multiple linear regression model that predicts a pupil’s score of a reading test (%) based on the following variables. Which of these variables are continuous:** (d, e)

   a. Pupil gender

   b. Geographic region of schools (6 categories)

   c. Pupil ethnicity (8 categories)

   d. Household income (£)

   e. Hours per week spent on reading

   f. Reading test score (%)

   g. Free school meal eligibility (yes/no)

2. **If you are using an explanatory variable with 9 categories in regression, how many dummy variables will you need to create?** (b)

   a. 9

   b. 8

   c. 2

   d. 0

3. **A regression model has a pupil’s score on a cognitive ability test as the outcome variable and three explanatory variables: gender (0 = girl, 1 = boy), recent maths test score (%) and recent English test grade (0-20). The coefficients for the model are shown below.**

   **What would be the predicted score on the cognitive ability test for a girl who scored 80% in Maths and 10 in English?** (b)

   a. 60

   b. 110

   c. 109

   d. Insufficient information

4. **Which are the correct statements regarding multicollinearity?** (d, e)

   a. Examining a scatterplot of residuals against the predicted outcome can help you identify the multicollinearity.

   b. The variance of the residuals is the same at each level of the predictor variables.

   c. There is a multicollinearity issue if a sample has a disproportionately strong influence over your regression model.

   d. The VIF can be used to identify the multicollinearity issue.

   e. Two or more explanatory variables are highly correlated with one another.

5. **Compared with R2, the adjusted coefficient of determination (Adj R^2) accounts for** (b) 

​		a. the number of dependent variables in the model

​		b. the number of independent variables in the model

​		c. unusually large value of predictors

​		d. none of the above

6. **Which are logistic regression models?** (a, b, c)

​		a. Building a model to predict whether a student will fail in this module

​		b. Constructing a regression to predict tomorrow's weather in central London (weather being one of the following types: sunny, rainy, cloudy, stormy)

​		c. Predicting the energy level of buildings based on the Google street view images (energy levels including A, B, C, D, E)

​		d. Building a model to predict the module grade (continuous value from 1 to 100) of a student based on whether they live in student halls (two types, YES/NO)
