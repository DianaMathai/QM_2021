1. Which of these metrics measures the variability of a interval or ratio variable?
   1. Standard deviation
   2. Range
   3. Variance
   4. Upper Quartile
2. I am calculating the covariance between two pairs of variables: age vs weight and age vs income. If the standard deviation of the income variable is larger than the standard deviation of the age variable, which pair will have higher covariance?
   1. age vs weight
   2. age vs income
   3. Not enought information
3. Which pair will have a higher Pearson correlation coefficient
   1. age vs weight
   2. age vs income
   3. Not enough information
4. Which of the following statements about the connection beteen the R^2 value from linear regression and the Pearson correlation coefficient are true?
   1. They are the same
   2. For a pair of variables, the R^2 from linear regression is equal to the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient.
   3. They measure different things
5. Plotting the residuals of a linear regression can help identify which of the following?
   1. If there is a linear relationship
   2. If errors are normally distributed
   3. Equal variance of residuals for all values of X
6. Two variables are analysed with a linear regression model: y = mx +c. A high R^2 value but non-significant p-value for variable x suggests what?
   1. That the data does not have a linear relationship
   2. The gradient of the relationship is approximately zero
   3. The data is very spread out
